## WHOM AM I  

Howdy, Welcome to My GitHub! 🤝 🤝 🤝
I am a Research Scientist at Danforth Plant Science Center in [Dr. Christopher Topp's](https://www.danforthcenter.org/our-work/principal-investigators/christopher-topp/?gclid=CjwKCAjwq5-WBhB7EiwAl-HEkkpa5rW6ZKuXjOh1Fbl_LAGusGbGwA_A2AAtbsjx6sFXSGGJA04HaRoCfs8QAvD_BwE) Root Genetics lab. 
My research focuses on developing genomics and data analysis pipelines for crops like weedy rice, corn, sorghum, and pennycress.

With a Ph.D. in Plant Breeding and Genetics from Texas A&M University, I bring expertise in statistical data analysis, molecular biotechnology, command-line interface (CLI) tools, and population genetics. My background includes an impressive track record in the biotechnology industry, where I have applied computational and experimental approaches to solve key challenges in plant science.

I am actively seeking collaborations in Plant Breeding, Genetics, Bioinformatics, and Molecular Biology. If you’re interested in working together or discussing exciting research opportunities, feel free to connect and collaborate! 🚀
